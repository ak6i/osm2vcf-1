# OSM2VCF

A [userscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript_manager) for easily downloading [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) node data as a [vCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard).

To install this script:

1. Install a userscript manager into your browser. Userscript managers are simply browser add-ons ("extensions") that can be acquired from your browser's default Web Extension installation screens. The author likes using the [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) Web browser with the [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) userscript manager.
1. [Click here](https://github.com/meitar/osm2vcf/raw/master/osm2vcf.user.js).
1. Confirm the installation, usually by pressing the "`Allow`," "`Install`," or "`OK`" button in the dialogue window that opens.

To use this script, navigate to any [node](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Node) or [way](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Way) on OpenStreetMap's Web interface.
